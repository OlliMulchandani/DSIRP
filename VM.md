# Virtual Memory

Virtual memory is a memory management technique that allows a computer to compensate for shortages of physical memory by temporarily transferring pages of data from random access memory (RAM) to disk storage. This allows a computer to run larger programs and perform more complex tasks than it would be able to do with only physical memory.

## Advantages of Virtual Memory

- Allows a computer to run programs that are larger than the available physical memory
- Helps to improve the performance of a computer by allowing it to store frequently used data in fast-access memory (RAM)
- Provides a degree of protection against the effects of memory errors and memory leaks

## Virtual Memory Management

Virtual memory management involves the allocation and management of virtual memory for a computer system. This includes:

- Determining which pages of data should be stored in physical memory and which should be stored on disk
- Allocating sufficient virtual memory for each program and process running on a computer
- Monitoring and adjusting the virtual memory usage of a computer to ensure optimal performance
